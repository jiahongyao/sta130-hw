    "Understanding the Contradiction:\n",
    "I explained that R-squared measures the proportion of variability explained by the model, while p-values and coefficients show the significance of individual predictors. The contradiction arises because these two metrics assess different aspects: R-squared shows overall model fit, and p-values show the significance of predictors, which can be strong even if the model doesn’t explain much of the total variability.\n",
    "Key Takeaways:\n",
    "A low R-squared means the model doesn't explain much of the data’s variability, but that doesn’t mean the predictors are unimportant — they might still be statistically significant.\n",
    "Statistically significant coefficients (with large values) indicate a strong effect of the predictor, even if those predictors don't account for much of the overall variance.\n",
    "Concepts Clarified:\n",
    "I highlighted the difference between R-squared (explanatory power of the model) and p-values (evidence against the null hypothesis for individual predictors), clarifying that they are complementary but assess different model aspects."

It does this for different subsets of the data (e.g. only generation 1 or multiple generations) and evaluates performance using a metric called R-squared, which tells us how well the model explains the data."
